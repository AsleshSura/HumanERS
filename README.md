# 🌊 HumanERS - Human Emotion Recognition System

**Multi-Sensory AI-Powered Communication & Survival System**

An advanced real-time emotion recognition system that uses computer vision and sensor fusion to detect and visualize human emotional states through facial expressions, hand gestures, eye tracking, and device motion. Originally designed as an innovative survival communication system for scenarios where verbal communication is impossible.

## 🎯 Project Concept

Imagine you're shipwrecked on an island with friends. The locals can't speak your language, but you desperately need to warn them about a dangerous sea monster. This system uses **ONLY** visuals, sounds, gestures, colors, and patterns - absolutely **NO text or numbers** - to create an emergency communication protocol that works across language barriers.

## 🤖 AI Technologies Integrated

### Core AI Models
- **Face-API.js** - Real-time emotion detection (fear, anger, calm, neutral, happiness, surprise, disgust)
- **TensorFlow.js Handpose** - Hand gesture recognition and movement analysis  
- **WebGazer.js** - Eye tracking and gaze direction detection
- **Web Audio API** - Breathing pattern analysis through microphone input

### Advanced Sensor Fusion Algorithm
Combines multiple inputs with weighted importance:
- **Facial Emotions**: 40% weight (fear expressions = danger, calm = safety)
- **Hand Gestures**: 30% weight (erratic movements = panic, smooth = safe)
- **Breathing Detection**: 20% weight (fast breathing = fear, slow = calm)
- **Eye Tracking**: 10% weight (looking up = fear, looking down = submission)

## 🎨 Visual Communication System

### Threat Level Colors & Symbols
- 🟢 **Green/White + ✨🏔️😊💤** = SAFE (0.0-0.2) - Calm, relaxed state
- 🔵 **Blue + 🌊🏔️👁️** = LOW THREAT (0.2-0.4) - Slight concern or alertness
- 🟡 **Yellow + 👁️🌀⭕** = MODERATE (0.4-0.6) - Noticeable emotional response
- 🟠 **Orange/Red + ⚠️🌊🔥** = HIGH CAUTION (0.6-0.8) - Strong emotional reaction
- 🟣 **Purple/Black + 💀👁️⚠️🌪️** = MAXIMUM DANGER (0.8-1.0) - Intense emotional state

### Dynamic Visual Effects
- **Background Colors**: Change based on emotional state
- **Particles**: Increase during high emotional intensity
- **Screen Effects**: Shaking and visual distortions at maximum intensity
- **Touch Canvas**: Interactive painting for visual communication

## 🔊 Audio Warning System

### Frequency-Based Alerts
- **40-100 Hz**: Deep bass rumble (monster presence/high stress)
- **220-440 Hz**: Harmonious tones (safety mode)
- **400-800 Hz**: Rising frequency alerts (caution)
- **800-1200 Hz**: Sharp chaotic tones (immediate danger)

### Binaural Beats
Psychological conditioning through carefully tuned frequencies that correlate with threat levels for enhanced communication.

## 🚨 Recent Improvements & Fixes Applied

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser with WebRTC support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Camera access permissions
- Microphone access permissions
- HTTPS connection (required for camera/microphone access)

### Installation

1. **Clone or Download** the repository to your local machine
2. **Serve the files** using a local web server (required for camera access):

   **Option 1: Using Python**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to project directory
   cd HumanERS
   
   # Python 3
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Python 2
   python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
   ```

   **Option 2: Using Node.js**
   ```bash
   # Install a simple HTTP server
   npm install -g http-server
   
   # Navigate to project directory and start server
   cd HumanERS
   http-server
   ```

   **Option 3: Using Live Server (VS Code)**
   - Install the "Live Server" extension in VS Code
   - Right-click on `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server"

3. **Open in Browser**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or the port shown by your server)
   - Grant camera and microphone permissions when prompted

## 📱 How to Use

### Initial Setup

1. **Grant Permissions**: When you first load the page, your browser will ask for:
   - Camera access (required for facial emotion detection)
   - Microphone access (for breathing pattern analysis)
   - Allow both for full functionality

2. **Position Yourself**: 
   - Sit 2-3 feet away from your camera
   - Ensure good lighting on your face
   - Keep your hands visible for gesture detection

- **Looking Down** - Indicates calm or contemplative state
- **Gaze Direction** - Eye position affects background gradient center
- **Blink Patterns** - Rapid blinking can indicate stress

### 4. Breathing Patterns
- **Fast Breathing** (>80 BPM) - Triggers fear response mode
- **Slow Breathing** (<50 BPM) - Activates calm safety state
- **Controlled Breathing** - Helps maintain steady emotional state

### 5. Touch Interaction
- **Screen Painting** - Creates visual ripples and persistent marks
- **Touch Intensity** - Pressure affects visual feedback
- **Pattern Drawing** - Leave temporary marks that fade over time
- **Color Communication** - Different touch areas create different colors

### 6. Device Motion (Mobile)
- **Shake Device** - Immediately increases threat level to maximum
- **Steady Holding** - Maintains current emotional assessment
- **Tilt/Rotation** - Affects visual orientation

## 🎯 Tips for Best Results

### For Accurate Emotion Detection:
1. **Lighting**: Ensure your face is well-lit and clearly visible
2. **Distance**: Stay 2-3 feet from the camera
3. **Stability**: Keep your device steady (unless testing shake detection)
4. **Clear View**: Keep hands and face unobstructed
5. **Natural Expressions**: Use genuine emotions for best detection

### For Effective Communication:
1. **Start Calm**: Begin in a relaxed state to establish baseline
2. **Gradual Changes**: Make slow, deliberate emotional expressions
3. **Consistent Gestures**: Use repeatable hand movements
4. **Practice Breathing**: Use controlled breathing for accurate readings
5. **Touch Interaction**: Combine with visual painting for emphasis
